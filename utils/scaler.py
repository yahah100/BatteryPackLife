    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        The input data tensor
    weights
        The weight tensor (same shape as data)
    padding_mask
        The padding mask tensor (same shape as data)
    dim
        The dimension along which to compute statistics (must be -1, the time dimension)
    minimum_scale
        Minimum scale value to use
    use_bessel_correction
        Whether to use Bessel's correction to get an unbiased estimator
    stabilize_with_global
        Whether to use global statistics to stabilize the causal statistics by clamping
        extreme values
    scale_factor_exponent
        Exponent that controls the allowed range of deviation from global scale.
        For example, with exponent=1.0, causal scale must be between 0.1x and 10x the global scale.
        With exponent=2.0, the range would be 0.01x to 100x.
    prefix_length
        If specified, the global statistics will be computed using only the prefix length
        requested. This is used for multistep decoding, where we only want to use the
        initial historical data to compute the global statistics. If stabilize_with_global
        is False, this parameter is ignored.
