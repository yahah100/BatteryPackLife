## Highlights
- **The largest battery life dataset:** BatteryLife is created by integrating 16 datasets, providing more than ninety thousand samples from 990 batteries with life labels. This is 2.5 times the size of BatteryML, which is the previous largest battery life resource.
- **The most diverse battery life dataset:** BatteryLife contains 8 battery formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operation temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols. Compared with the previous largest battery life resource (BatteryML), BatteryLife furnishes 4 times format, 11.8 times chemical system, 1.8 times operating temperature, and 2.2 times charge/discharge protocol.
- **A comprehensive benchmark for battery life prediction:** BatteryLife provides 18 benchmark methods with open-source codes in this repository. The 18 benchmark methods include popular methods for battery life prediction, popular baselines in time series analysis, and a series of baselines proposed by this work.

## Quick start

### Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Preprocessing [[tutorial](./assets/Preprocess.md)]

After downloading all raw datasets provided in "Data availability" section, you can run the following script to obtain the processed datasets:

```
python preprocess_scripts.py
```
If you download the processed datasets, you can skip this step.

### Train the model [[tutorial](./assets/Model_training.md)]

Before you start training, please move all **processed datasets (such as, HUST, MATR, et al.)** folders and **Life labels** folder (downloaded from Hugginface or Zenodo websites) into `./dataset` folder under the root folder.

After that, just feel free to run any benchmark method. For example:

```sh
sh ./train_eval_scripts/CPTransformer.sh
```

If you want to evaluate a model in detail. We have provided the evaluation script. You can use it as follows:

```sh
sh ./train_eval_scripts/evaluate.sh
```

### Fine-tuning [[tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#Fine-tuning)]

If you want to fine-tune the pretrained model to another dataset. We have provided the fine-tuning script and the [tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#Fine-tuning). You can use it as follows:

```shell
sh ./train_eval_scripts/finetune_script.sh
```

### Domain adaptation [[tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#domain-adaptation)]

If you want to do the domain adaptation to another dataset. We have provided the domain adaptation script and the [tutorial](./assets/Transfer_learning.md#domain-adaptation). You can use it as follows:

```shell
sh ./train_eval_scripts/domain_adaptation_script.sh
```

## Data Structure

The data structure of the standardized data is described in [Data_structure_description.md](./assets/Data_structure_description.md).

## Welcome contributions

To facilitate advances in battery life prediction, the community needs standardized datasets. However, the available battery life datasets are typically stored in different places and different formats. We have put great efforts in integrating 13 previously available datasets and 3 of our datasets. We warmly welcome contributions from the community to further enhance this collection by submitting datasets standardized according to the BatteryLife standards. 

If you are interested in contributing, please either submit a pull request or contact us via email at rtan474@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn and whong719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn. Kindly include a list of contributors in your pull request or email. We will acknowledge all contributors in the acknowledgement section of this repository.
