## Highlights

- **The largest battery life dataset:** BatteryLife is created by integrating 16 datasets, providing 99,000 samples from 990 batteries with life labels. This is 2.5 times the size of BatteryML, which is the previous largest battery life resource.
- **The most diverse battery life dataset:** BatteryLife contains 8 battery formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operation temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols. Compared with the previous largest battery life resource (BatteryML), BatteryLife furnishes 4 times format, 11.8 times chemical system, 1.8 times operating temperature, and 2.2 times charge/discharge protocol.
- **A comprehensive benchmark for battery life prediction:** BatteryLife provides 18 benchmark methods with open-source codes in this repository. The 18 benchmark methods include popular methods for battery life prediction, popular baselines in time series analysis, and a series of baselines proposed by this work.

## Quick start

### Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Preprocessing [[tutorial](./assets/Preprocess.md)]

After downloading all raw datasets provided in "Data availability" section, you can run the following script to obtain the processed datasets:

## Welcome contributions

Advancing AI4Battery requires standardized datasets. However, the available battery life datasets are typically stored in different places and in different formats. We have put great efforts into integrating 13 previously available datasets and 3 of our datasets. BatteryLife serves as a platform to share all kinds of standardized datasets. We warmly welcome contributions from the community to further enhance this collection by providing datasets standardized according to the BatteryLife standards.

If you are interested in contributing, please either submit a pull request or contact us via email at rtan474@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn and whong719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn. To integrate your data into the BatteryLife repositories, please provide:

- Raw datasets
- Processed datasets
- Preprocessing scripts (for reproducibility)
- A list of contributors (for acknowledgment in the repo)
- Papers related to the data generation (we will prompt users to cite these in the repository's Citation section).
